Finding somewhere affordable to live in Britain is hard.
 Some parts of the country are cheaper than others, of course, but the cost of renting a home is horrendous, especially in London and the South.
 Normally, the only answer is to share a house or a flat: you get a room of your own, but you have to share the kitchen and bathroom.
 In cities like Oxford and Cambridge, where rooms are scarce, prices will make your eyes water: more than £500 a month. In London, they’re even higher – not far off £700.
