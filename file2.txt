Oxford already seemed expensive when I lived there, and that was almost 40 years ago.
 When I started work after university, my room cost £40 a month – almost 15 per cent of my salary.
 With today’s rents in Oxford, you’d need to earn £40,000 a year if you didn’t want to spend more than 15 per cent on your room.
 But when you finish university, starting salaries are usually between £20,000 and £30,000.
